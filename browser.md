> To build an indie browser that isn't based on Chromium/WebKit or Gecko that works with modern HTML 5 & the web.
```

* Ship [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox) by default
* [Non-political](https://polarhive.ml/blog/firefox/#heres-what-mozilla-should-do) - Look what happened to Mozilla
* Built in a memory safe, fast, cross device language.
* No telemetry out of the box (disabled by default).
* [Libre/freely](https://polarhive.ml/blog/free-libre-software/) licensed and copylefted so that the user is under control.
* No DRM / Widevine CDM
* Available on GNU/Linux (libre operating systems). I may be port to proprietary platforms like like MacOS or Windows later on depending on available resources.
* Use compatible components from the Chromium/Gecko projects like [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) or [media encoders](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d).
